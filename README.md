* most of this code was wrtitten as I was learning the intricacies of genes/introns/exons, so the naming conventions might be a luittle confusing
* the application loads a set of xls files upon startup and caches the matrix for faster access

* the PPARG amino acid sequence is a static element in the MatrixParser.java file
