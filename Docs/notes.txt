step 1:
- given: protein position and letter
  - get: number from matrix

step 2:
- given position
  - get: alleles with ref as default
- given alt allele
  - from position, divide by 3 to get protein position
  - get 3 letter segment with alt letter in it
  - determine what protein letter maps to 3 letter dna seq
  - from protein position and protein letter, get number from matrix




questions:
- where to store the appication
  - do we need a domain name
- what to show when person inputs reference allele p.Leu99Leu


probability/p-value

- steps
  - get the log value from matrix (called log_matrix)
  - get the prevalence (prev)
  - prevalence odds ratio: odds_ratio = (1 - prev) / prev
  - lopg = log_matrix + log(odds_ratio)
  - get prob as (exp(logp) / (exp(logp) + 1))
  
- ex
  - for 342p
    - log_matrix = -19.01062
    - prev = 0.00001
    - odds_ratio = 99999
    - logp = -19.010602 + 11.51 = -7.4977         -> probaility of beginity is exp()
    - exp(lgp) -> probablity of beinogn
    - 1 - exp(lgp) -> prob of pathogenicity
    
    - BAD -> prob = exp(-7.4977) / (exp(-7.4977) - 1) = 0.00056 / (1 - 0.00056) = 

- if > .999 greater 99%
- --.-% percent for in between
- if < .001 less that 0.1%
