step 1:
- given: protein position and letter
  - get: number from matrix

step 2:
- given position
  - get: alleles with ref as default
- given alt allele
  - from position, divide by 3 to get protein position
  - get 3 letter segment with alt letter in it
  - determine what protein letter maps to 3 letter dna seq
  - from protein position and protein letter, get number from matrix
